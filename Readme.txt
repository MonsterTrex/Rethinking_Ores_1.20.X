Rethinking Ores by MonsterTrex

Ever wonder why Minecraft is so stale regarding progression of tools and armor? Well now you can bring more variety to your playthroughs with the use of this mod! Found some amazing gold tools from a broken nether portal? No problem - enhance it with copper plating to make it more durable! Need to have an in-between tier between iron and diamond? No problem - either create steel armor using iron smelting, or dig up new Platinum or Titanium ores to progress forwards!

Copper is abundant, and due to this fact, you need to create copper plating to make it usable in the form of tools and armor - this can be made using 4 Copper ingots, the rest is the same as default recipes. Copper is a tier between stone and iron, making it a fairly decent starting tier for armor and tools before you farm iron in more dangerous environments.

Copper Plating can be used in order to upgrade golden tools/armor to make it more durable while retaining the same enchantments you might find around your world - simply place the golden tools/armor into a smithing table alongside copper plating and you'll be ready to use more durable, but similarly performing golden tools/armor!

Steel can be made by refining and forcing more carbon into iron in the form of smelting iron ingots into Pig Iron, which then smelts into Steel. Steel is 60% more durable than iron and slightly more enchant-able.

Platinum is a fairly abundant ore down below y=128 and only gets more frequent the lower down you go - used in the same way as any other smelt-able ore is. Platinum is a big step up from Iron, but is about 60% less durable (iron being 85%) than Diamond, but is the most enchant able material, even more than gold, alongside some diamond-tier perks.

Titanium is more frequent than diamond but less so than iron, or platinum, found anywhere under y=64 - used in the same way as any other smelt-able ore is. Titanium is an even bigger step up from Iron, but again, is about 50% less durable than Diamond, but does have certain characteristics of netherite tier tools/armor.
